# Q1. Create a table “Station” to store information about weather observation stations:

create table Station( 
ID NUMBER NOT NULL, 
CITY CHAR(20) NOT NULL, 
STATE CHAR(2) NOT NULL, 
LAT_N NUMBER NOT NULL, 
LONG_W NUMBER NOT NULL, 
PRIMARY KEY (ID) 
);

#Q2. Insert the following records into the table:

insert into Station values (13,'PHOENIX','AZ',33,112);
insert into Station values (44,'DENVER','CO',40,105);
insert into Station values (66,'CARIBOU','ME',47,68);

#Q3. Execute a query to look at table STATION in undefined order.

select * from Station;

#Q4. Execute a query to select Northern stations (Northern latitude >39.7).

SELECT * FROM STATION WHERE LAT_N>39.7

#Q5. Create another table, ‘STATS’, to store normalized temperature and precipitation data:(There will be no Duplicate ID and MONTH combination.)

CREATE TABLE STATS( 
ID NUMBER NOT NULL, 
MONTH NUMBER(1,12) NOT NULL, 
TEMP_F NUMBER(-80,150) NOT NULL, 
RAIN_I NUMBER(0,100) NOT NULL 
)

#Q6.Populate the table STATS with some statistics for January and July:

INSERT INTO STATS VALUES (13,1,57.4,.31);
INSERT INTO STATS VALUES (13,7,91.7,5.51);
INSERT INTO STATS VALUES (44,1,27.3,.18);
INSERT INTO STATS VALUES (44,7,74.8,2.11);
INSERT INTO STATS VALUES (66,1,6.7,2.1);
INSERT INTO STATS VALUES (66,7,65.8,4.52);

#Q7. Execute a query to display temperature stats (from STATS table) for each city (from Station table).

Select CITY,MONTH,TEMP_F from Station p inner join STATS i on p.ID=i.ID;

#Q8. Execute a query to look at the table STATS, ordered by month and greatest rainfall, with columns rearranged. It should also show the
corresponding cities.

Select p.CITY,i.ID,i.MONTH,i.TEMP_F,i.RAIN_I from station p inner join STATS i on p.ID=i.ID order by RAIN_I desc;
